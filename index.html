    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system 
        enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.
        Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web 
        servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and 
        resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character 
        strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still very 
        common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language 
        (HTML). The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which
         provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web 
         surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across 
         multiple websites.</p></body>
